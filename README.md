# WSCoachMarksView

WSCoachMarksView is an iOS drop-in class that displays user coach marks with a rectangular cutout over an existing UI. This approach leverages your actual UI as part of the onboarding process for your user. Simply define an array of rectangles (CGRect) and their accompanying captions.

## Requirements

WSCoachMarksView works on any iOS version and is built with ARC. It depends on the following Apple frameworks:

* Foundation.framework
* UIKit.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

## Adding WSCoachMarksView to your project

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add WSCoachMarksView to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for WSCoachMarksView to your Podfile `pod 'WSCoachMarksView', '~> 0.2'`
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.
3. Include WSCoachMarksView wherever you need it with `#import "WSCoachMarksView.h"`.

### Source files

Alternatively, you can directly add the `WSCoachMarksView.h` and `WSCoachMarksView.m` source files to your project.

1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/workshirt/WSCoachMarksView/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project.
2. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `WSCoachMarksView.h` and `WSCoachMarksView.m` onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.
3. Include WSCoachMarksView wherever you need it with `#import "WSCoachMarksView.h"`.

## Usage

Create a new WSCoachMarksView instance in your viewDidLoad method and pass in an array of coach mark definitions (each containing a CGRect for the rectangle and its accompanying caption).

```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
	[super viewDidLoad];

	// ...

	// Setup coach marks
	NSArray *coachMarks = @[
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{0,0},{45,45}}],
			@"caption": @"Helpful navigation menu"
		},
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{10.0f,56.0f},{300.0f,56.0f}}],
			@"caption": @"Document your wedding by taking photos"
		},
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{10.0f,119.0f},{300.0f,56.0f}}],
			@"caption": @"Your wedding photo album"
		},
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{10.0f,182.0f},{300.0f,56.0f}}],
			@"caption": @"View and manage your friends & family"
		},
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{10.0f,245.0f},{300.0f,56.0f}}],
			@"caption": @"Invite friends to get more photos"
		},
		@{
			@"rect": [NSValue valueWithCGRect:(CGRect){{0.0f,410.0f},{320.0f,50.0f}}],
			@"caption": @"Keep your guests informed with your wedding details"
		}
	];
	WSCoachMarksView *coachMarksView = [[WSCoachMarksView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds coachMarks:coachMarks];
	[self.view addSubview:coachMarksView];
	[coachMarksView start];
}
```

Remember to add the coach marks view to the top-most controller. So in you have a navigation controller, use:

```objective-c
WSCoachMarksView *coachMarksView = [[WSCoachMarksView alloc] initWithFrame:self.navigationController.view.bounds coachMarks:coachMarks];
[self.navigationController.view addSubview:coachMarksView];
[coachMarksView start];
```

You can configure WSCoachMarksView before you present it using the `start` method. For example:

```objective-c
coachMarksView.animationDuration = 0.5f;
coachMarksView.enableContinueLabel = NO;
[coachMarksView start];
```

Example of how to show the coach marks to your user only once (assumes `coachMarksView` is instantiated in `viewDidLoad`):

```objective-c
- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
	// Show coach marks
	BOOL coachMarksShown = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] boolForKey:@"WSCoachMarksShown"];
	if (coachMarksShown == NO) {
		// Don't show again
		[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:YES forKey:@"WSCoachMarksShown"];
		[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];

		// Show coach marks
		[coachMarksView start];

		// Or show coach marks after a second delay
		// [coachMarksView performSelector:@selector(start) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.0f];
	}
}
```

## Configuration

### `coachMarks` (NSArray)

Modify the coach marks.

### `lblCaption` (UILabel)

Access the captions label.

### `maskColor` (UIColor)

The color of the mask (default: 0,0,0 alpha 0.9).

### `animationDuration` (CGFloat)

Transition animation duration to the next coach mark (default: 0.3).

### `cutoutRadius` (CGFloat)

The cutout rectangle radius (default: 2px).

### `maxLblWidth` (CGFloat)

The captions label is set to have a max width of 230px. Number of lines is figured out automatically based on caption contents.

### `lblSpacing` (CGFloat)

Define how far the captions label appears above or below the cutout (default: 35px).

### `enableContinueLabel` (BOOL)

'Tap to continue' label pops up by default to guide the user at the first coach mark (default: YES).

## WSCoachMarksViewDelegate

If you'd like to take a certain action when a specific coach mark comes into view, your view controller can implement the WSCoachMarksViewDelegate.

### 1. Conform your view controller to the WSCoachMarksViewDelegate protocol:

`@interface WSMainViewController : UIViewController <WSCoachMarksViewDelegate>`

### 2. Assign the delegate to your coach marks view instance:

`coachMarksView.delegate = self;`

### 3. Implement the delegate protocol methods:

*Note: All of the methods are optional. Implement only those that are needed.*

- `- (void)coachMarksView:(WSCoachMarksView*)coachMarksView willNavigateToIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
- `- (void)coachMarksView:(WSCoachMarksView*)coachMarksView didNavigateToIndex:(NSUInteger)index`
- `- (void)coachMarksViewWillCleanup:(WSCoachMarksView*)coachMarksView`
- `- (void)coachMarksViewDidCleanup:(WSCoachMarksView*)coachMarksView`
